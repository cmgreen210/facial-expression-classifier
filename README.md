##Overview

<a name="install"/>
##Installation
First, install [OpenCV][1] and register for [GraphLab][2]. After this is done run the following:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/cmgreen210/facial-expression-classifier
pip install -r requirements
```
If all tests with the below command pass from the top level directory then you are good to go!
```bash
nosetests .
```

##Model
Each model in the package wraps GraphLab's `NeuralNetClassifier` except for the base logistic regression class which uses Scikit-Learn. The easiest way to train a feed forward neural net with this package is to specify an architecture in `net.conf` and then run the `train_nn.sh` script, specifying the appropriate argruments. You don't need to specify the connections between each layer of the net configuration because the training code assumes a linear order between layers.

This package was written to classify human facial expressions. Data for this problem can be found [here][3]. In order to process and pickle the raw data files see code in `gl_data.py`. If you are experimenting it is recommended that you run your classifications with Dato's GraphLab Createâ„¢ with GPU Acceleration on a gpu to speed up your training.
